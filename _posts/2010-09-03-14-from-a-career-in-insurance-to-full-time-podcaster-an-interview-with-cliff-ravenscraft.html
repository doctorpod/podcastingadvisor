  content: "Andy, I loved this interview. Your humour and approach was spot on. Especially
    liked the \"Clifford\". \r\n\r\nInteresting to hear Cliff's take on the Lame encoder.
    Hadn't heard that one before. \r\n\r\nWhat was the software Cliff uses to play
    \"live\" clips when recording his shows. Didn't catch that?\r\n\r\nKeep up the
    good work. This is the podcast I look most forward to each week."

  content: "Good show Andy - and a great interview with Cliff (what a man).\r\n\r\nI
    don't know if it was a phone or skype thing, but your speech audio was clear and
    had full depth. However, for some reason Cliff's voice audion was quite muddy.\r\n\r\nKeep
    up this great podcast.\r\n\r\nBest regards from New Zealand\r\n\r\nAndrew"

  content: Thanks for the heads up Andrew - Cliff was coming in on his Heil PR40 which
    is an outstanding mic - but he was over Skype so maybe that was it.

In today's show I chat with Cliff Ravenscraft, of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;podcastanswerman.com" target="_blank">PodcastAnswerMan.com<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>Cliff shares his story of how he took a leap of faith and went from a career in insurance to a full time podcaster and then podcasting coach. A great interview and some terrific tips from Cliff.</p>
<p>Also:</p>
