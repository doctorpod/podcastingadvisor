It's time to get started in podcasting.

I start off talking about headsets in general - Plantronics do nice ones.

<strong>DISCLOSURE</strong>: Most of the links to purchase are <strong>AFFILIATE LINKS</strong>. I'll get a commission if you end up buying the product. This helps me to feed my children. If you don't want his to happen just use Google.

For a good condenser microphone &#8211; take a look at the Samson C01U. Get it from <a href="http://www.dolphinmusic.co.uk/product/6948-samson-c01u.html" target="_blank">Dolphin Music (UK)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samson-CO1U-USB-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B000AP1RE8" target="_blank">Amazon.com (USA)</a>.

The Blue Snowball is another condenser microphone  worth considering. You can buy this from <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Blue-Microphones-Snowball-Microphone-White/dp/B000EOPQ7E" target="_blank">Amazon.co.uk (UK)</a>, <a href="http://store.apple.com/uk/product/TF238LL/A" target="_blank">Apple Store (UK)</a>, <a href="http://www.dolphinmusic.co.uk/product/35872-blue-microphones-snowball-bundle.html" target="_blank">Dolphin Music (UK)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphones-Snowball-Microphone-White/dp/B000EOPQ7E" target="_blank">Amazon.com (USA)</a>

Both these mics plug straight into your computer via USB.

I talk about the Shure SM58 - this is a popular, robust dynamic microphone  (It's the one I use on this podcast). Bear in mind with this mic that you'll need something to plug it into - it has an XLR plug that won't plug directly into your computer. You'll need an XLR to USB interface, a mixer or a separate audio recorder with XLR inputs such as the Zoom H4.

Purchase the SM58 from <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Shure-SM58LCE-SM58-Vocal-Microphone/dp/B000CZ0R42" target="_blank">Amazon.co.uk (UK)</a>, <a href="http://www.dolphinmusic.co.uk/product/2022-shure-sm58.html" target="_blank">Dolphin Music (UK)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shure-SM58SE-SM58S-by/dp/B000GUBOYU" target="_blank">Amazon.com (USA)</a>.
