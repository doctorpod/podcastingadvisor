In a rather short show today I go into the scintillating world of audio post production - and specifically normalisation. So don your propeller hats and prepare to enter the world of the audiophile. It'll be worth it though - because this is laying the foundation for the other post production stuff we need to cover such as audio compression - more of that in a later episode...

In other news - here's [Julia's podcasts](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-bare-truth/id301310523).
