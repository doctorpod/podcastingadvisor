Jim has a number of podcasts, all based around the paranormal, ghosts, spooky stories and things that go bump in the night:</p>

<div>Jim says that podcasting changed his life. Jim started out in the media side of radio, then discovered podcasting - being inspired by Adam Curry and Leo Laport. Always being passionate about the paranormal, Jim decided to do a show where he interviewed experts in the field (a great strategy). Later, Jim teamed up with Clayton Morris to do the Paranormal Report and Kate Botello (who used to co-host with Leo Laporte on The Screen Savers) on&Acirc;&nbsp;Weird&Acirc;&nbsp;News Radio, his latest show.<&#47;div></p>
<div>In this interview, Jim gives some great insights into the way podcasting can open doors. He also gives us some great podcasting quotes. Jim uses <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.vodburner.com&#47;" target="_blank">Vodburner<&#47;a> to produce his Paranormal Report videocast - this allows you to record two video and two audio streams simultaneously - great fro recording a Skype video interview - check it out.<&#47;div></p>
<div>Jim also has a new book out - <a href="http:&#47;&#47;jimharold.com&#47;jims-book&#47;" target="_blank">Jim Harold's Campfire - True Ghost Stories<&#47;a>.<&#47;div></p>
