Audio and video have different modes of consumption.

Video:

* is immersive
* is a foreground process - at computer/media player/TV
* is visual - great for screencasts, demonstrations,
* needs to be short - people won't watch long videos
* is consumed depending on people's context - if people find themselves at computer
* is just preferred by some people

Audio:

* is a background process
* can be consumed while doing other things - driving, operating machinery
* can be longer form

We need to aim for similar results though:

* Engaging
* Informative
* Entertaining
* Inspiring

Ask yourself some standard questions - if YES to any then consider video:

* Am I explaining how to use software? - go for a screencast
* Am I showing how to do something?
* Would I find a video of this more helpful than a video?
* Will the visual aspect add any other value?

Talking head videos are not always bad!
Think of video as an additional channel - utilise YouTube - potential good exposure - 2nd biggest search engine
