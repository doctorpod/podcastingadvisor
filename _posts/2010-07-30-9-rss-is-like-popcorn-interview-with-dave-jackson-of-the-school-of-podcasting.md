I was delighted to spend some time yesterday morning talking with Dave Jackson of [the School of Podcasting](http://schoolofpodcasting.com/). Dave gave some interesting stories and insights into podcasting:

* A simple way of explaining what a podcast is
* How podcasting can help you get a job
* How podcasting doesn't have to be about making money
* How to evaluate the best content for a podcast
* What made Dave start podcasting
* A simple explanation of RSS using a popcorn analogy
* The steps forward for those hesitating with podcasting
* Top tips when starting a podcast
