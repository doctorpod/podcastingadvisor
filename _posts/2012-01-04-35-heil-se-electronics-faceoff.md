  content: "Hi\r\n\r\nI follow your work a while and you really help me to choose
    a nice mic for my podcast. I just watch the video and really like it, but i think
    that a condenser microphone it's a lot of better than any dynamic mic and i really
    want one SE Electronics 2200T for me too lol\r\n\r\nCheers and Happy Birthday"

  content: "Happy Birthday Andy!\r\nI listened to this wandering through the woods
    here in Sweden with my woofs. \r\n\r\nHaving come back and watched this time it
    proved even more useful. The Heil is excellent but I was surprised by the richness
    of the condensor mic. I use a Heil and really love it and think it is the way
    to go in a non-soundproofed environment; however, the condensor could very well
    be worth checking out if you have a soundbooth or something for voiceovers. \r\n\r\nLove
    the podcast and wish it came out more regularly !"

  content: "Re: the background noise, they both sounded pretty much the same when
    I listened on my way to work Andy.\r\n\r\nI also listened to the SM58 v PR40 face
    off and thought the SM58 reduced the background noise better.\r\n\r\nI would have
    liked you have drawn some sort of conclusion from these tests, any chance of that?
    \ \r\n\r\nI use the SM58 s little brother the Shure PG48 (costs &Acirc;&pound;30)
    and I get a fantastic quality sound from that.  I personally feel you don't need
    to invest mega bucks to get good sound quality from a mic for podcasting purposes
    and that spending a lot of money on a mic is overkill.  Plus you always compress
    the audio considerably (I compress to 64kbps) when converting to MP3 which generally
    reduces audio quality."
