<p><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 0 25px 5px 0; border: black solid 1px;" src="http:&#47;&#47;media2.wireworldmedia.co.uk&#47;PA&#47;dr-chris-smith.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="134" &#47;>In today's episode I talked to Dr Chris Smith who has been podcasting since 2001 (predating even the mighty Adam Curry)! Now that's early. Chris produces and presents the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.thenakedscientists.com&#47;" target="_blank">Naked Scientists Podcast<&#47;a>&Acirc;&nbsp;- which started as a radio show. Chris tells how he put the show on the Internet for people to download and how the podcast audience exploded in 2005 as iTunes opened its Podcast Directory.</p>
<p>Chris gives some interesting insights into content creation and getting feedback from your listeners - including setting up core samples of your audience as focus groups. He also covers how great content can carry your content even if you're not a&Acirc;&nbsp;big name brand.</p>
<p>On another note - I'm running the Brighton Marathon in the Spring - <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.justgiving.com&#47;doctorpod&#47;" target="_blank">please sponsor my Brighton Marathon run for The Martlets Hospice<&#47;a> ;)</p>
