In today's episode I talked to Dr Chris Smith who has been podcasting since 2001 (predating even the mighty Adam Curry)! Now that's early. Chris produces and presents the [Naked Scientists Podcast](http://www.thenakedscientists.com/) - which started as a radio show. Chris tells how he put the show on the Internet for people to download and how the podcast audience exploded in 2005 as iTunes opened its Podcast Directory.

Chris gives some interesting insights into content creation and getting feedback from your listeners - including setting up core samples of your audience as focus groups. He also covers how great content can carry your content even if you're not a big name brand.
