  content: "I'm not sure if you need a different feed for every user or if a single
    \"premium feed\" would do. If you only need two feeds, one premium and one free,
    hand coding the premium feed wouldn't be too difficult. Rob from Podcast411 has
    a tutorial on creating RSS feeds by hand: http:&#47;&#47;www.podcast411.com&#47;howto_1.html
    \r\n\r\nYou'd create a directory on your server to keep the file and share the
    link after they paid. But if your members share the link with other members, you've
    got no recourse. You'd need to password protect the directory but then you'll
    need some software or one person can lock-out the password and screw everyone.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're using Wordpress there are many membership plugins that will allow individualized,
    secure, RSS feeds. Here is a review of some popular ones: http:&#47;&#47;www.wp-handyhints.com&#47;wordpress-ecommerce-plugins&#47;wordpress-membership-site-plugin-reviews&#47;\r\n\r\naMember
    and \"Your Members\" aren't in this review but are also worth checking out."
