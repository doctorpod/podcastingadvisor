    find the following two posts I wrote recently interesting:\r\n\r\nhttp:&#47;&#47;joedale.typepad.com&#47;integrating_ict_into_the_&#47;2010&#47;07&#47;recording-skype-with-mfl-friends-family.html\r\n\r\nhttp:&#47;&#47;joedale.typepad.com&#47;integrating_ict_into_the_&#47;2010&#47;07&#47;mimi-jones-on-phlogging-a-trip-to-england-france-and-spain-with-ipadio-and-facebook-1.html\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, we met at PodCampUK in 2007 and you taught me how to mix tracks together
    using Audacity to avoid hard stereo separation:\r\nhttp:&#47;&#47;joedale.typepad.com&#47;integrating_ict_into_the_&#47;2007&#47;09&#47;podcasting-pear.html\r\n\r\nBest

  content: Hi Andy, another great and really interesting &amp; useful podcast - thanks.
    For my iPhone, I have used "Audio Memos" app to record stuff. There is a free
    and paid-for version. I've only recorded short memos but easy to do. To upload
    the files to your PC you still need to do that trick of linking through your wi-fi,
    but not too difficult. You can see info at http:&#47;&#47;itunes.apple.com&#47;us&#47;app&#47;audio-memos-the-voice-recorder&#47;id290160980?mt=8

  content: "Hey Andy, \r\nGreat podcast.... I've got a Zoom H2\r\nIt records well,
    but I agree with you that the build quality is pretty plasticy (if theres such
    a word) and worse than the H4. As you say it does have a handle you can plug into
    it to hold and its important to use. However even witht he handle, if you move
    your hand then  you get an awful grinding noise going through mic!  It has no
    xlr which is a pain as you say and overall I wish i'd paid a bit more money and
    got the H4. \r\nH4 everytime people!"

  content: Thanks for this Antony. This is exactly what we need - user experience
    - nice one. I think the H4 has now been superseded by the H4n but  I may be wrong
    - anybody?
