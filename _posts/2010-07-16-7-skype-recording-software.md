  content: "Hi Andy, \r\nLoving the podcasts. I'm just listening to the skype podcast
    as this week i've been testing out skype with my equipment ready for the start
    of the Yomps podcasts in the coming weeks. You said on it about Skype out and
    in Europe you need to charge with Euros. Hoever if you change your skype preferences
    in the account section when you logon and change your currency preference to Sterling.
    \r\nKeep up the good work. \r\nAntony"

After a rough, sleepless, windy night, followed by an afternoon power nap, I discuss the oft-asked topic of recording conversations from [Skype](http://www.skype.com). We start the show with a voice question from Kathryn Colas of [Simply Hormones](http://simplyhormones.com/) - she's starting the [Simply Hormones Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/simply-hormones-podcast/id392551162?mt=2).

Software mentioned:

* [Audio Hijack Pro](http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/)
* [Pamela](http://www.pamela.biz)
* [Pretty May](http://www.prettymay.net/)
