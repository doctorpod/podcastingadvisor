How to stop that annoying popping sound on your spoken audio.

Links to YouTube videos where I review some mics:

* [Shure SM58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_8PhV6gF0c) (you can see the pop filter in front of the mic)
* [Samson C01U condenser mic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPjQGXe_MK4)

You can get pop filters at many electronics and music outlets - for online options look at [Dolphin Music (UK)](http://www.dolphinmusic.co.uk/product/4570-samson-ps-01-pop-shield.html), [Amazon.com (USA)](http://www.amazon.com/Samson-PS01-Microphone-Pop-Filter/dp/B0002ORPN4). This [pop filter by Rode from Dolphin Music (UK)](http://www.dolphinmusic.co.uk/product/5966-rode-rps-1000-pop-shield.html) has a small clamp which should be well suited to the Blue Snowball **<--- AFFILIATE LINKS :)**
