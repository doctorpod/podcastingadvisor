  content: "Hi Andy - thanks  - this info is really useful and I've already set up
    my account - as soon as I heard the episode. \r\n\r\nThought the US podcasters
    used Google Voice which I gather isn't available in the UK \r\n\r\nIs there going
    to be a pod cast meet up (or have I missed it)? I thought it was mentioned on
    either your podcast or by kelvin. \r\n\r\nAll the best"

As far as I can tell, there aren't many turnkey solutions for setting up a voicemail answer line in the UK. In this episode I show you how to do this using [Sipgate](http://www.sipgate.co.uk).
