As you may know wee have been offering video for a while now.

Last week I met [Greg Brand](https://twitter.com/travizeo) of [Travizeo](http://www.travizeo.com/) who produces videos for a variety of clients - I thought he'd be the perfect guy to talk to about how to start making videos whether they be a video podcast or a one off for YouTube or your website.

Greg mentioned video sitemaps. Neither of us were sure if these were the same as normal sitemaps. It turns out they are, in fact, a [separate extension of the Sitemap protocol](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2007/12/introducing-video-sitemaps.html).
