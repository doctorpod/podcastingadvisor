  content: Hi Matt - Sorry for the delay getting back. I had a quick look at this
    and I'm not sure of the value it provides. I've always stuck to a bit rate of
    128 MBit&#47;s on my MP3s and as far as I know that has always been fine. With
    podcasts people are not streaming them to listen - they download them first and
    listen later so these sorts of tweaks are not so relevant - that's my feeling.

<p>After a networking trip to Lewes, I cover the concept of audio compression. What is compression? Why do we use it? How do we use it? All answered in today's episode.</p>
