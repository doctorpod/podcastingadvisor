  content: "Great stuff, Andy! Love these podcasts. \r\n\r\nI've been using tracks
    from Music Bakery and love their selection (although they could do with something
    that's  targeted for younger audiences). Thanks for sharing more suggestions to
    check out. \r\n\r\nBTW: where did you get the (brilliant) theme for Podcasting
    Advisor?"

  content: Thanks for this, Jon. It's great to feedback on stuff I haven't used -
    priceless. I got the music for this podcast from http://opuzz.com - it's
    called Spy and Die (a bit of a negative title I know - but a catchy tune ;) )

* [Music Bakery](http://musicbakery.com)
* [Opuzz](http://www.opuzz.com)
