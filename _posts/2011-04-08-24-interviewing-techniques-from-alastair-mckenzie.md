  content: "Hi Andy\r\n\r\nJust wanted to say how much I enjoyed this episode especially
    as it was coming from someone with so much experience going all the way back to
    the days of tape.\r\n\r\nAlastair's hints are brilliant and depending on which
    of my podcasts that I'm working on will depend on which of the different tips
    I'll take from what he's said.\r\n\r\nThe tip of always recording an atmos track
    is brilliant. I've always only grabbed a bit of audio from a pause to fill a hole
    but to record an entire track in a controlled environment then use it to lay under
    track and build the illusion of the scene is a great take home for me.\r\n\r\nThere
    were many, many great tips in this show.\r\n\r\nThanks so much for it. It will
    add one more facet to this rough gem that I'm polishing.\r\n\r\nP.S. FYI&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;
    My other podcast is at YourStoryPodcast.com"

  content: "Hi, Andy. Great job on the interview with Alastair McKenzie. He might
    enjoy listening once more to Copland's Fanfare for the Common Man and to Hoedown
    from Rodeo.  They are completely different pieces. I was so impressed that he
    interviewed Stephen Cleobury, too. This episode of the podcast had more than your
    usual share of great tips. Thanks.\r\n\r\nCheers! Michael"

  content: "Andy -  just wanted to take a moment to tell you how great the content
    was with Alastair.  His tips on interviewing and creating an atmosphere for the
    listener were timeless.  I especially liked being on the look out for recording
    music to be used as a bed under the interviewing/reporting.... catching the
    beginnings and endings of songs that will uniquely add character to the piece.
    \  I also appreciated how we need to always be thinking ahead (like sitting at
    the front of the bus) in order to be ready to capture the critical key moments.
    \  So much great stuff.  I plan on listening to it again.\r\n\r\nThanks so much,\r\n\r\nDr.

I met [Alastair McKenzie](https://twitter.com/alastairmck) at the Travel Bloggers Unite 2011 event in Manchester a couple of weeks back. Alastair is an x-radio journalist/editor, now turned to the Internet. In this interview he gives us some killer tips on interviewing and post production with particular reference to using atmospheric backgrounds - great stuff!
